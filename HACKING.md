# Hacking

This document explains how to run locally [Juno](https://juno.build).

## Run locally

```
git clone https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno
cd juno
npm ci
dfx start --clean
```

First, deploy II:

```
dfx deploy internet_identity
```

Collect "internet_identity" canister ID and update [client/src/main.ts](client/src/main.ts) (if not `rrkah-fqaaa-aaaaa-aaaaq-cai`).

Next, deploy the "old" ledger.

Run `npm run ledger:account-id` to get the account identifier for the principal use in NodeJS script.

Then, to install the `ledger` do the two following things:

1. Update the account identifier you just got in the installation script [./script/ledger.sh](./script/ledger.sh)

2. update the entry in `dfx.json` with the private did file

```
"ledger": {
  "type": "custom",
  "wasm": "ledger.wasm",
  "candid": "ledger.private.did"
}
```

then run command line

```
./scripts/ledger.sh
```

Revert `dfx.json` and double check that you received the balance:

```
npm run ledger:balance
```

Next, install the Cmc (note its canister ID should reflect the one on mainnet):

```
./scripts/cmc.sh
```

Next finally deploy Juno canisters:

```
dfx canister create console --specified-id cokmz-oiaaa-aaaal-aby6q-cai
dfx deploy observatory --specified-id klbfr-lqaaa-aaaak-qbwsa-cai
dfx deploy console
```

Finally, install mission control center + satellite wasm and deploy frontend:

```
dfx deploy mission_control (it will fail because it needs a user as init param but we need to deploy it for dfx to be able to install the frontend)
dfx deploy satellite (same same)
npm run console:install:wasm
dfx deploy frontend
```

## Development

To run the console:

```
npm run dev
```

## Top-up

Top-up the local console with some cycles:

```
npm run console:topup
```
