## 🚀 Introduction

Juno is a reimagined serverless platform built for modern developers who want more control, strong security, and zero operational complexity.

It offers a familiar cloud-like experience—without the DevOps overhead—powered by decentralized infrastructure.

With built-in support for authentication, storage, hosting, serverless functions, and even on-chain logic, Juno simplifies the entire backend. Everything runs in one container, giving developers full ownership and security by design.

In short, Juno is what Firebase would look like if it were built for the future. ⚡️
