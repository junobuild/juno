## Summary

This release formalizes a delivery focused on frontend changes in the Console.

The most noticeable change is a rework of the "Monitoring" section, which now provides clearer information about the status of your modules.

We now fetch memory metrics directly from the Internet Computer management interface. This gives more granular data, which is now displayed. A new polar diagram has also been added to show where most of the data is stored.

This update also introduces a new "Health Check" section, which explains when and why a module can become frozen during its grace period. The goal is to help anticipate such events.

In relation to this, the presentation of the "auto-refill threshold" was improved, as the previous wording was misleading. Auto-refill doesnâ€™t trigger when the threshold alone is reached, but when enough cycles are available to cover both the grace period and the threshold. This is now referred to as the "threshold trigger".

## Overview

> [!NOTE]
> No new versions of the modules (smart contracts), crates or libraries included.
