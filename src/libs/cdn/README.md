# JunoBuild-Cdn

`junobuild-cdn` provides the CDN capabilities used by [Juno](https://juno.build) , including logic for serving assets and handling request-based storage workflows.

## Getting Started

To include `junobuild-cdn` in your Rust project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
junobuild-cdn = "*"

Replace `"*"` with the specific version you want to use, or omit the version to always use the latest version.
